  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root 'home#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
    get 'accounts/:id/toggle_active' => 'accounts#toggle_active'

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
    resources :modules
    resources :accounts
    resources :tags

  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'

  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do

  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do

  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
